# smartref [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erikvalkering/smartref.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erikvalkering/smartref)
A modern header-only zero-overhead library for creating smart references

## Abstract

`smartref` is a *pure-library* solution for creating smart reference classes using C++11/14/17, and comprises two parts: the `using_` class-template, which acts as a *reusable* base-class for smart references, and a tiny reflection facility, which is used for supporting user-defined types. Together, they provide a new building block with which powerful zero-overhead abstractions can be created, today.

## Introduction

Smart references are a fundamental missing building block of the C++ language, and are a long-demanded feature [by the C++ community](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/1990/WG21%201990/X3J16_90%20WG21%20Request%20for%20Consideration%20-%20Overloadable%20Unary%20operator.pdf). They allow for creating objects that act as if they are other objects, like proxies, rebindable references, properties, strong typedefs, etc.

There currently exist several proposals for adding language support for smart references, ([p0416r1](https://wg21.link/p0416r1), [p0060r0](https://wg21.link/p0060r0), [p0352r1](https://wg21.link/p0352r1)). Despite the demand for language support, it does seem there is currently no consensus yet which direction to pursue.

The `smartref` library is an attempt to provide this missing building block, but instead as a pure-library solution. Furthermore, its syntax is based on the smart reference proposal from p0352r1 - "Smart References through Delegation", which arguably leads to a very intuitive way of thinking about how to design smart references.

## Overview

The core of the `smartref` library is the `using_` class-template, from which _smart reference_-classes can derive.

##### The `using_` class-template:
* Parameterizes over the *delegate type*.
* Obtains the *delegate object* from the derived class.
* Defines members, corresponding to those found in the delegate type.
* Member-*functions* forward the call to the delegate object.
* Member-*types* are aliases for the types defined in the delegate type.

##### The smart reference class:
* Defines a conversion function which returns the delegate object.
* Derives from the `using_` class, and thereby inherits the interface from the delegate type.

## Example: a proxy class for on-demand loading from disk

For example, it becomes reasonably easy to implement a `proxy` class, for on-demand loading from disk of some wrapped container class (e.g. `std::vector`), while providing exactly the same interface as the wrapped class:

```c++
template<typename T>
class proxy : public using_<T>
{
    T data_;

public:
    operator T &()
    {
        // ...lazy-load data_
        return data_;
    }
};
```

Now, `proxy` provides exactly the same interface as the wrapped `std::vector<double>`, while every function call is 'intercepted' by the conversion function.

It can be used as follows:
```c++
proxy<vector<double>> v = read_from_file(...);

v.push_back(3.141592654);

for (auto &x : v)
{
    x *= 2;
}
```

## Batteries included

Out of the box, the `using_` class-template defines member-functions and member-types corresponding to all those found in the data types defined by the STL. More importantly, this support is generic: any type satisfying (part of) the interface of an STL type, is also supported out of the box.

## User-defined types

In order to support user-defined types, their members need to be explicitly registered.

For this, the `smartref` library comes with a tiny reflection facility, which provides a non-intrusive `REFLECTABLE` macro. By annotating the name of a member using this macro, this member will be picked up automatically by the `using_` class-template:

```c++
class Person
{
public:
    auto first_name() {...}
    auto last_name() {...}
};

REFLECTABLE(first_name);
REFLECTABLE(last_name);
```

which could be used as follows:
```c++
template<typename T>
auto greet(const T &person)
{
    cout << "Hi, " << person.first_name() + " " + person.last_name() << endl;
}

auto real_person  = Person{...};
auto proxy_person = proxy<Person>{...};

greet(real_person);
greet(proxy_person);
```

Note that in the example above, the `greet()` function generically supports both the `Person` class, as well as the `proxy<Person>` class.

## Completion Status

The implementation has been tested using the following compilers:
- Clang 4.0.1

## How to use

##### Manually
Because the `smartref` library is a header-only library, using the library is just a matter of adding the `include` directory to the list of include directories while building your project. Furthermore, there are no other dependencies than a modern C++ compiler with support for C++17 (although currently only clang-4.0 is officially supported).

Also note that all the library classes are in the `smartref` namespace. The `examples` directory, as well as the `tests` directory contain lots of examples demonstrating how to use the `smartref` library.

##### Using Conan
In case you're using the [Conan C/C++ package manager](https://www.conan.io), it's very easy to use the `smartref` library in your project.

First, install the conan package:
```bash
> conan remote add smartref-conan-remote https://api.bintray.com/conan/erikvalkering/smartref 
> conan install smartref/master@erikvalkering/unstable -r smartref-conan-remote --build smartref
```

Now, you can add the `smartref` library as a requirement in your project's `conanfile.txt` (or `conanfile.py`):
```ini
[requires]
smartref/master/erikvalkering/unstable
```

##### Running the unit tests
If you would like to run all the unit tests, you can do this quite easily, by executing the following commands:
```bash
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> cmake --build .
```

this will create several test executables, which can be invoked using:
```bash
> ctest
```
